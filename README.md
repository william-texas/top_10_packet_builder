# top_10_packet_builder

This script (pulled directly from my mario kart channel project code, only modified to open files instead of download them) will create a top 10 packet based off of ghost files you give it. name them each ghost1.rkg, ghost2.rkg, etc.
In the examples folder, you can find 10 ghosts that are named in the proper format, and then also an output XML file which was created using those 10 ghosts.


P.S, if someone really wanted to, they could recreate their own RACE server by using this script and modifying it a little bit. If you want to make your own functional RACE server, I recommend you check out http://mkc.rc24.xyz/RaceService as that is a fully functional and accurate one that I have created already, before you try to create yours.

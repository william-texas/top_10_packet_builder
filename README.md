If someone really wanted to, they could recreate their own RACE server by using this script and modifying it a little bit. If you want to make your own functional RACE server, I recommend you check out http://mkc.rc24.xyz/RaceService as that is a fully functional and accurate one that I have created already, before you try to create yours.
